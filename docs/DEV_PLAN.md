## ✅ **WarehouseSim Refactoring Plan Recap**

---

### **PHASE 0 – Prototype Foundation** ✔️
> Modular simulation with reservation-aware planning and CLI tools.

- ✅ A* planner with space-time reservation table
- ✅ TaskManager with multiple goal assignment strategies
- ✅ World stepper engine with basic conflict checks
- ✅ CLI runner via `run.py`
- ✅ GIF/MP4 animation export via `visualizer.py`

---

### **PHASE 1 – Coordination & Conflict Resolution** 🟢 In Progress

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| `ConflictResolver` with `wait`, `replan`, `idle` | ✅ Done |
| Runtime blocking & replan logic | ✅ Done |
| Overlap logger | ✅ Done |
| Two-phase movement logic (experimental) | ⛔️ Rolled back — not optimal yet |
| ✅ Scrollable overlap logs in UI | ✅ Done |

---

### **PHASE 2 – Planner Abstraction + Strategy Injection** ✔️

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| `BasePlanner` interface | ✅ Done |
| `get_planner()` factory | ✅ Done |
| A* strategy injected via CLI | ✅ Done |
| Planner-ready modular structure | ✅ Done |
| Support for new planners (Greedy, CBS, etc.) | 🟡 Ready to implement |

---

### **PHASE 3 – Metrics, Debugging, and Analysis** 🟡 Planning

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Overlap log aggregation | ✅ Done |
| `world.get_summary()` | ✅ Implemented |
| Heatmap or stats export (`.json`, `.csv`) | ⏳ Not yet |
| Bar chart / histogram of task counts | ⏳ Not yet |
| Event types: `BLOCKED`, `REPLAN`, etc. | 🟡 Logging partially active |

---

### **PHASE 4 – UI / Visualization Layer** 🟢 Active

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Streamlit UI with sliders & buttons | ✅ Done |
| Display latest animation in app | ✅ Done |
| Downloadable MP4 export | ✅ Done |
| Scrollable overlap log | ✅ Done |
| Side-by-side control and visual | 🟡 Possible enhancement |
| Inline animation preview (mp4) | ⏳ Optional upgrade |

---

### **PHASE 5 – Packaging & Distribution** ✅ Ready

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| `pyproject.toml` with dependencies | ✅ Done |
| Project structured as installable package | ✅ Done |
| `README.md` with architecture + CLI + UI info | ✅ Done |
| Streamlit app added to project root | ✅ Done |
| Testable via `pip install .` | ✅ Confirmed |

---

### 📦 Optional Future Phases (Post-polish)

- 🧠 Plug in Greedy, WHCA*, CBS, or M*
- 🧪 Unit tests via `pytest`
- 🚀 Publish to PyPI or GitHub Releases
- 📈 Real-time dashboard for metrics
- 🤖 Gym or PettingZoo wrapper for RL training
- 🛰️ Sim-to-real bridge (ROS / MQTT)
